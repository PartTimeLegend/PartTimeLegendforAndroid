ANNOUNCEMENT
============

Unfortunately my computer has died and due to a lack of continous employment over the recent months I am currently unable to purchase a replacement machine at this point.

I will therefore no longer be developing this software until I am able to purchase a replacement.

It is always a little rude to ask for donations, but as I am developing this software free of charge for everyone to use. I will therefore be accepting donations towards the purchase of a new machine.

PartTimeLegend.co.uk for Android
================================

Just a really simple Android application writen with the [MIT App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/).

All it really does is launch [PartTimeLegend.co.uk](http://www.parttimelegend.co.uk). I'm rewriting it with [mono for Android](http://xamarin.com/monoforandroid) as I get time.

I'm a .NET Developer so I prefer the feel of Visual Studio. This was a quick and dirty app.
